# Experimental characterisation of a superconducting quantum interference device

## Abstract
We present measurements of the key properties of a superconducting quantum
interference device (SQUID), including the critical current threshold for
superconductivity, the periodic oscillations in the voltage across the device
with changing magnetic field and discrete Shapiro steps in voltage when a
microwave-frequency electric field is applied. We establish rigorous techniques
for analysing the relevant data that may be applied to other SQUIDs and
sensitive magnetic field measurements.
